# Configuring OpenWrt to work with Japan SoftBank hikari IPv6 high-speed internet "IPv4 over IPv6" service

## The Brackground 

SoftBank requires renting an ISP-specific router, the "BB Unit," to enable IPv6 IPoE for stable Internet access and to avoid PPPoE congestion during peak hours. However, the BB Unit has significant performance and firmware limitations, the most critical being its lack of NAT loopback support. This means that accessing services bound to domain names within the local network requires manually mapping the domain to the LAN IP address via the hosts file.

Connecting a standard router directly to the ONU without the BB Unit allows access to the IPv6 Internet via IPoE, but IPv4 remains restricted to PPPoE, which suffers from instability due to NTTâ€™s legacy infrastructure. Currently, no commercially available routers in Japan natively support SoftBank's 4in6 tunneling, and online resources for configuring IPoE IPv6 + IPv4 are scarce. Most guides suggest enabling DMZ, allowing IPv6 passthrough, and disabling Wi-Fi transmission to achieve a bridge-like setup.

However, this approach is not an ideal solution for obtaining a stable IPv4 connection with a fixed IP address. After extensive research, I successfully configured high-speed IPv6 on OpenWrt. This article outlines the configuration process in hopes of assisting other SoftBank users facing similar challenges.

# SoftBank IPv4 over IPv6 Configuration Guide  

## Preparation  

To establish a connection using IPv4 over IPv6, you will need the following:  

- **Local IPv6 address**: `2400:0000:0000:a000:1111:1111:1111:1111`  
- **Local IPv4 address**: `126.000.00.000`  
- **Remote IPv6 address (Peer)**: `2400:2000:0:0:a000::00`  

## Accessing SoftBank BB Unit  

You can easily find your **local IPv6 and IPv4 addresses** after connecting the SoftBank BB Unit to the Internet.  

### Step 1: Open the Router Admin Page  
In your web browser, go to one of the following URLs:  

- [http://172.16.255.254/index.html](http://172.16.255.254/index.html)  
- [http://192.168.3.1](http://192.168.3.1)  

### Step 2: Login Credentials  
Use the following login details to access the SoftBank BB router:  

- **Username**: `user`  
- **Password**: `user`  

### Example Interface

Record these two addresses for future use.

## Getting the remote IPv6 address (peer) 

However, obtaining the **remote IPv6 address (peer)** is more challenging. When I contacted SoftBank Hikari customer support, they were unable to provide this information. Fortunately, you can determine the peer address by capturing network packets using **Wireshark**.
